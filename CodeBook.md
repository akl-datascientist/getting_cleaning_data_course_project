## Project Description

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data. In this project, I demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The result of this project is a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

The data utilized in this project were collected from the accelerometer and the gyroscope embedded in a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

##Study design and data processing

In this section, I give a brief overview of the data and how they were acquired.

###Collection of the raw data

Thirty volunteers in the age group of 19--48 years were asked to perform six activities: Sitting, Standing, Laying, Walking, Walking-upstairs, and Walking-downstairs. Volunteers performed these activities while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the smart phone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were acquired at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to enable manual annotation of the data.

##Creating the tidy datafile

In this section, I describe the tidy dataset and how it was created.

###Guide to create the tidy data file

The tidy dataset was created by completing the following main stages:
1) Downloading the original data file and extracting its contents to the working directory.
2) Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3) Extracting only the measurements pertaining to the mean and standard deviation for each feature.
4) Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the tidy dataset.
5) Appropriately labeling the dataset with descriptive variable names. 
6) Averaging each feature for each activity and each subject.
7) Writing the tidy dataset to text file named "tidy_dataset.txt"

Please refer to the README.md file for a detailed description of the creation of the tidy dataset.  

##Description of the variables in the tiny_dataset.txt file
The tidy dataset is a data frame composed of 180 observations (rows) and 68 variables (columns). Here is a summary of the 68 variables:

###Variable 1: subject
Variable subject indicates the number of the subject who carried the experimet. 30 subjects were recruited.

Here are the details summarizing this variable:  
 - Class: numeric  
 - Unique values: 1, 2, 3, ..., 30  
 - Unit of measurement: no unit of measurement  
 
###Variable 2: activity
Variable subject indicates the number of the subject who carried the experimet. 30 subjects were recruited.

Here are the details summarizing this variable:  
 - Class: Factor  
 - Unique values: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS    
 - Unit of measurement: no unit of measurement    
 
###Variables 3 - 68:
Variables 3 - 68 represent features extracted from the accelerometer and the gyroscope signals. For each volunteer, the acquired signals from the accelerometer and the gyroscope were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap, which is equivalent to 128 readings per window. The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force was assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.   

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of the signals was calculated using the Euclidean norm of the signals in the x-, y-, and z-directions. Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing features in the frequency domain.  

As a result, from each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. Here are the details summarizing these features:  
 - Class: numeric  
 - Unique values: all variables were normalized to be between -1 and 1  
 - Unit of measurement: no unit of measurement  
 - Since temporal and frequency features were extracted from the data, a particular schema was followed to construct the names of the variables. Here is a glossary of the words and letters:  
   * t: temporal feature  
   * f: frequency feature  
   * Body: the body-component of the acceleration signal  
   * Gravity: the gravity-component of the acceleration signal  
   * Acc: acceleration feature  
   * Gyro: gyroscope feature  
   * mean: mean  
   * std: standard deviation  
   * X: in the x-direction  
   * Y: in the y-direction  
   * Z: in the z-direction  
   * Jerk: jerk signals obtrained by taking the derivative of signals in time   
   * Mag: magnitude of the signal in the x-, y-, and z-directions  
   
For example, the feature tBodyAcc.mean.X represents the mean value of the body-component of the acceleration signal in the x-direction in time domain.
